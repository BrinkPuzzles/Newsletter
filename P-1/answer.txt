The error (Javascript):

// make letter a = code 0

hash_code += c.charCodeAt() - 'a'.charCodeAt()

Insisting that letter “a” should be zero means that some characters will have a negative code, which means it’s possible to have a digest that is zero. The word “chickadee's” is one of them. (Apostrophe is lower in Unicode than “a.”)

Zero digests are eliminated as filler, causing the “slip.” You change the line to:

hash_code += c.charCodeAt()

and all the soaps line up.
